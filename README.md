# Pokelert - Pokémon Go Slackbot 

This slackbot uses the popular [PokemonGo-Map](https://github.com/AHAAAAAAA/PokemonGo-Map) as an API to notify slack channels about nearby Pokémon. The project will focus on creating a conversational bot UI utilizing online PoGo Tools to help your Slack team be the very best, that no one ever was.
